## Overview

This is a basic static website built with plain HTML, created as a personal practice project to explore static deployment using GitHub Pages. It serves as a reminder of my early days as a Front End Developer, using the technologies I've worked with most recently.

## Technologies used

- Nodejs
- Gulp (v4) + Babel (uglify, rename, sass, inject)
- Sass
- Nord color palette
- Font Awesome
- JQuery
- Deployment using github pages

### Note:
This repository is not a focus of my main development work but serves as a simple project to experiment with deployment.
