            <p>My name is Carlos Alonso Rondoni, but you can call me Carl. I was born in Barcelona on February 20, 1984. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to explore different aspects of life, from my love of reading to my passion for programming.</p>
            <p>Reading has always been one of my greatest passions. Though Iâ€™ve dabbled in writingâ€”participating in short story contestsâ€”Iâ€™m not yet a full-time author.</p>
            <p>My journey into programming began with Windows XP and quickly expanded into my love for video games, with Doom being one of my all-time favorites. Since then, programming has taken center stage in my life.</p>
            <p>Outside of tech, Iâ€™m passionate about nature, hiking, and spending time outdoors. Iâ€™m also drawn to tarot and taoism, which fuel my creativity and personal growth.</p>
            <p>Programming is the field that has truly sparked my passion. I consider myself an enthusiastic, dedicated, and sometimes perfectionist individual. While I tend to focus on the details, I believe thatâ€™s what makes me who I am. ðŸ˜›</p>

        <a href="#as-a-developer" class="accordion-title"><h2>As a Developer</h2></a>
        <div id="as-a-developer" class="accordion-content">
            <p>My path in technology began early, experimenting with CPC computers and delving into programming. Over the years, I honed my skills through various programming languages, tools, and frameworks, ultimately working in startups and agencies, including a French startup where I spent five years as a Full Stack Developer.</p>
            <p>My career has evolved toward specializing in Back End Development, with a strong focus on microservices and system architecture. I am constantly learning, whether itâ€™s through contributing to open-source projects or sharing my own through GitHub. My goal is to continually refine my skills and push the boundaries of what I can achieve, particularly in the areas of DevOps and cloud-native architectures.</p>
            <p>Programming is not just a job for me, but a lifelong pursuit of mastery. With a deep interest in writing and minimalism, I aim to integrate these passions into both my technical work and future literary projects.</p>
