            <p>My name is Carlos Alonso Rondoni, but you can call me 'Carl.' I was born in Barcelona on February 20, 1984, and since then, I have had the opportunity to explore the world.</p>
            <p>Throughout my life, I have always had a strong affinity for reading, enjoying books, comics, and magazines. I consider being an avid reader one of my main passions. I have also dabbled in writing, participating in some short story contests, although not as a full-time dedication.</p>
            <p>My interest in programming began when Windows XP arrived in our homes. Since then, video games have become a significant part of my life, with one of my favorites being Doom (the pixelated version).</p>
            <p>Music is another important aspect of my life. I started playing the guitar when my father gave me his to practice some songs. I immersed myself in it and had the opportunity to play with various groups at different times. However, as life often goes, there came a point where I had to make choices, and I put music on the back burner. Nevertheless, not a day goes by without me picking up my guitar and improvising something in private.</p>
            <p>I also have other interests, such as nature, going on hikes and nature trails, learning to care for and coexist with it. Role-playing games and tarot are other passions of mine, which I use as tools to fuel my imagination.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have ventured into various sectors, but programming has been the only one that has truly ignited the passion within me.</p>
            <p>I describe myself as an enthusiastic, dedicated, and passionate person. One of my challenges might be perfectionism, which occasionally leads me to get stuck in the details, but it is part of who I am. ðŸ˜›</p>

        <div id="as-a-developer" class="accordion-content">
            <p>My journey in the world of technology began in my childhood, as I explored CPC computers and delved into programming. Over time, my passion for programming and technology led me to experiment with various languages and tools, from Windows 2000 to Symfony and Golang. I worked in startups and agencies before joining a French startup as a Full Stack Developer, where I gained experience in a variety of technologies during my five-year tenure.</p>
            <p>However, my desire for new challenges led me to my current role as a Back End Developer focused on microservices. In this position, I have had the opportunity to refine my Back End skills, delve into the world of DevOps and system architecture, and from there, share my own projects through my GitHub profile. Throughout my career, I have consistently maintained my passion and dedication to programming, and I continue to seek opportunities for learning and growth in this exciting field.</p>
